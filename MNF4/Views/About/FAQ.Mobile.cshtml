    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="hours">When are you open?</h4>
        <p>
            We are open Monday through Saturday, by appointment only.&nbsp; We often have “off-site”
            speaking engagements, training sessions, or volunteer activities, therefore we are
            not always “in” the office and therefore do not take walk-in clients.&nbsp; Typical appointment
            times are between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.</p>
    </div>

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="insurance">Do you accept insurance?</h4>
        <p>
            At the present time, no, we do not accept insurance for nutrition or fitness appointments.
            However, for people who are getting the mediator release test (MRT), an outside
            lab (Signet Diagnostic) does the testing, so as a courtesy to our clients we will
            verify insurance coverage of MRT.</p>
    </div>

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="charge">What do you charge?</h4>
        <p>
            This depends on the client and what type of appointment they are seeking.&nbsp; Most clients
            (weight loss, sports nutrition, celiac, etc.) will need multiple appointments, therefore
            after the initial appointment, we will decide what is most cost effective (purchasing
            a package of 3 or 5, which includes the initial appointment.&nbsp; Clients who have food 
            sensitivities and plan to use MRT will pay for the MRT in addition to purchasing a package 
            of appointments for the individualized LEAP ImmunoCalm Dietary Management Program.</p>
    </div>

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="payplans">Do you offer payment plans?</h4>
        <p>
            No.&nbsp; Payment in full is expected at the time of service.&nbsp; For people who are unable
            to purchase packages, they may pay for their appointments one at a time.
        </p>

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="discounts">Do you offer discounts?</h4>
        <p>
            Yes.&nbsp; We are proud sponsors of Austin Fit and Tri Zones Training and offer their members a
            15% discount on initial appointments and 10% discount on packages.&nbsp; We also offer
            this same discount to members of Southwest Hills Community Church and employees
            of non-profit organizations such as the Capital Area Food Bank.

        <p>
            The majority of our clients are adults, however we will work with children on a
            case-by-case basis.&nbsp; We do not work with children younger than 8 years of age.

        <p>
            Yes, we work with families.&nbsp; The charge for this depends on the size of the family.
            “Packages” can often be used to cover the costs of family appointments.

        <h4 id="fitassess">What kind of fitness assessments do you offer?</h4>
        <p>
            This is an area that will be expanded in the future.&nbsp; Right now, we offer measurement

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="fitcounsel">What kind of fitness counseling do you offer?</h4>
        <p>
            This is another are that will be expanded in the future.&nbsp; Right now, we utilize resting
            heart rate and sub maximal heart rate data to work with endurance athletes to develop
            a training schedule.&nbsp; We also suggest various strength-training workouts.&nbsp; For clients
            who are “beginners” and will not necessarily be running/cycling/swimming long distances,
            we offer instruction on other types of exercise such as low impact cardiovascular
            activities and core strength training.&nbsp; Most clients do workouts on their own time,
            off site and bring “data” from their workouts (e.g. heart rates, time, distance,
            etc.) to follow up appointments for evaluation.

            ovary syndrome, vegetarian eating, and sports nutrition).&nbsp; The length of time varies

        <h4 id="metabolic">Do you check metabolic rate?</h4>
        <p>

        <p>
            Intrinsic Coaching® is a methodology that increases a person’s capacity to think
            better about choices and achieve better results, more quickly.&nbsp; Intrinsic coaching
            can be used to serve individuals and groups in a variety of areas: health care facilities,
            corporations, universities, etc.&nbsp; Here is some additional information on

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="mrtdef">What is MRT?</h4>
        <p>
            MRT stands for “mediator release test.” It is actually 150 separate tests using
            a blood sample and “challenging” that blood sample with 123 different types of foods
            and 27 different chemicals.&nbsp; Two different pathways in the immune system are involved
            in food sensitivities: type 3 and type 4.&nbsp; Depending on which pathway is used, the
            immune system will release different types of “mediators” to fight what ever it
            perceives as a threat.&nbsp; MRT is an end-point test, meaning it measures the release
            of mediators such as cytokines, histamine, prostaglandins, etc. at the end of the
            reaction (so it does not care which pathway is used, it just measures the immune
            system’s reaction to a perceived threat).&nbsp; 
            <a href="http://www.nowleap.com/public_tour/ibs/pop_ups/5/MRT-animation.html" target="_blank">Here 
            is an animation</a> of how the MRT works.

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="mrtwho">Who needs MRT?</h4>
        <p>
            MRT primarily benefits people with conditions affected by food sensitivities (not
            true food allergy), such as irritable bowel syndrome, migraines, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid
            arthritis and other autoimmune conditions, eczema, psoriasis, etc.&nbsp; Many athletes
            who suffer from gastrointestinal distress during training and competition also often
            benefit from MRT, as it allows them to identify foods that are more likely to cause
            them a problem.

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h4 id="leapdef">What is LEAP?</h4>
        <p>
            LEAP stands for “Lifestyle, Eating, and Performance.”&nbsp; It is a 6-phased dietary management
            program that utilizes the MRT to develop an individualized eating plan.&nbsp; The first
            phase allows the person to eat only their “safest” foods (usually limited to no
            more than 25 different items), and this phase typically lasts one week to 10 days.&nbsp; 
            Some people with very severe symptoms may need up to 2 full weeks to have their
            immune system “calm down.”&nbsp; Phases 2-5 are where 1 new food is added each day, so
            the length of time will vary depending on each person.&nbsp; Phase 6 is where a 3-day
            food rotation diet is implemented, and clients begin adding foods that may not have
            been tested.&nbsp; This is usually the time that people can also start “testing” the moderately
            reactive foods to see if their immune system has sufficiently healed to where they
            can tolerate small amounts of a previously reactive food.
