		<title type='text'>Heart Health Month and PCOS</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Happy Heart Health Month!&amp;nbsp; I know it's been a while since I've blogged, but I'm working on being more consistent.&amp;nbsp; ;-)&amp;nbsp; Please be aware that I am planning to move my blog to another site, so once I have the new URL I'll be sure to post it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Now, on to heart health month!&amp;nbsp; You have probably heard by now that heart disease is the number one killer of both men AND women.&amp;nbsp; For women with PCOS, heart health is of particular concern since this syndrome increases the risk of developing hypertension, high cholesterol, and other cardiovascular diseases.&amp;nbsp; My intention today is to give you a brief summary of what you can do with nutrition and fitness to lower your risk of heart disease. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Top of the list:&amp;nbsp; increase your fruits and vegetables!&amp;nbsp; Whole fruits and vegetables provide a lot of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that act as antioxidants. &amp;nbsp; The fiber can help lower cholesterol, minerals like potassium can potentially help lower blood pressure, and certain vitamins and other nutrients that act as antioxidants can help lower inflammation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;I just listened to an interesting webinar on concord grape juice and it's benefits for heart health.&amp;nbsp; What I found of interest was that one of the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20844075"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; mentioned showed that after drinking 16 ounces of concord grape juice daily for 8 weeks, there was a slight decrease in night time blood pressure (1.4 percentage points), and fasting glucose either remained the same or decreased up to 2 mg/dl in all of the study participants.&amp;nbsp; (The study was done on 64 adults who were pre-hypertensive or who had stage 1 hypertension and were not taking any medication.)&amp;nbsp; This is potentially good news for people who really enjoy grape juice, but have been afraid to drink it for fear that it would raise their blood glucose levels. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;It's important to remember that grape juice is a lot more concentrated than whole grapes (and therefore has a lot more calories), but it is likely that it can be safely consumed in moderation and can help contribute to your daily fruit quota, while potentially helping lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Next tip:&amp;nbsp; avoid trans fat.&amp;nbsp; This is the absolute worst kind of fat because it can lower your good cholesterol (HDL) while at the same time increasing your "bad" cholesterol (LDL). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;Finally, get moving!&amp;nbsp; The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), recommends everyone get a total of at least 30 minutes of physical activity at least 5 times per week for heart health.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;For more nutrition tips specifically for PCOS, please check out my new &lt;a href="http://www.marquettenutrition.com/eBooks/PCOS" target="_blank"&gt;eBook series.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;

		<title type='text'>IronMan Race Day Nutrition. . . for Sherpas!</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;Typically you read about sports nutrition for athletes or sport or fitness; today I want to talk about nutrition for the spectators, the coaches, the support crew. . . in other words, for the Sherpas!&amp;nbsp; That may not seem like a big deal, but if you are playing the role of Sherpa as I did recently, and you plan to be out on an Ironman course for upwards of 12 hours, you need to make sure that you are properly fueling yourself or you will not be of much support to your athlete. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;One of my fellow Sherpas mentioned a friend of hers actually had to be hospitalized from dehydration she experienced while spectating!&amp;nbsp; In addition, if you are prone to low blood sugar reactions, you also have to be mindful that you are eating frequently enough, and that your snacks/meals contain a combination of protein/carbohydrate/healthy fat. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;I recently attended IronMan (IM) in Tempe, AZ.&amp;nbsp; It was my husband Dan's first full Ironman Competition.&amp;nbsp; For those of you not familiar with IM, it is a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and 26.2 mile marathon.&amp;nbsp; Yes, all in one day.&amp;nbsp; Needless to say, I spent a lot of time working on Dan's nutrition (daily, training, and for competition).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;I, however, did not have an optimum sports nutrition plan laid out for my day out on the course.&amp;nbsp; I took snacks and water in a backpack, as well as money to buy food as needed.&amp;nbsp; I also had written out approximate times that Dan would be at certain parts on the course.&amp;nbsp; With these time estimates, I thought I would have time to take the train back to the condo we were staying in to eat a "real lunch" and "real dinner." Unfortunately, I did not take into account the timing of the other athletes I was there to watch. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;There were probably an additional 20+ athletes that I knew (or that my husband knew) who were competing.&amp;nbsp; There was also an equal number of Sherpas from Austin who were supporting these same athletes.&amp;nbsp; We made sure we all had each other’s contact information, and had tentative "breakfast" plans.&amp;nbsp; Because of the large number of athletes and Sherpas in attendance, my thinking that I would have time to take the train back to the condo for meals did not happen. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;Most of us arrived at the site around 5 a.m.&amp;nbsp; We all watched the swim start/finish and the start of the bike.&amp;nbsp; We then managed to have a very late breakfast/early lunch around 11 a.m.&amp;nbsp; After that, we headed back to the bike course.&amp;nbsp; From that point on, it became difficult to stay in contact with each other as we all had specific people we wanted to see start the run.&amp;nbsp; I did meet up with one friend and went to dinner at a little Mediterranean Restaurant just a few blocks from the race site around 6 p.m. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TPbsuCMAh8I/AAAAAAAAAq8/0dphCrIuJyQ/s1600/coffee+and+tea.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TPbsuCMAh8I/AAAAAAAAAq8/0dphCrIuJyQ/s320/coffee+and+tea.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;Tea and coffee; not the best for rehydrating!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;While I did manage to snack a little during the day, I did not drink nearly enough water, which made for a very dry mouth, slight headache, and chapped lips by the end of the day.&amp;nbsp; Not that big of a deal, but if I had not carried my own water bottle with me it could have potentially been much worse. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;So what are the lessons learned?&amp;nbsp; Keep track of how much fluid you are taking in; make sure you drink at least as much as you would on a normal day, preferably more depending on the weather conditions.&amp;nbsp; Take snacks that include both protein and carbohydrate (dried fruit, nuts, and seeds work great).&amp;nbsp; Set an alarm for at least 3 different times during the day when you will take a break and eat a meal and stick to it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Happy Halloween, Healthy Halloween???</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"&gt;I am feeling super inspired today.&amp;nbsp; I love being a healthy, vegetarian runner in a cool running town!&amp;nbsp; This morning I coached my running group through a great 9.5 mile run, with a few spicy hills tossed in for good measure.&amp;nbsp; The weather was just about perfect; a crisp 45 degrees to start, then the sun came out with just a mild breeze.&amp;nbsp; After finishing our run, I led us through some cool down stretches, then I went off to my local farmer's market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TMxiagGraKI/AAAAAAAAANc/WgLxnUtIGyc/s1600/Elaine+Michelle+Halloween+photo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TMxiagGraKI/AAAAAAAAANc/WgLxnUtIGyc/s1600/Elaine+Michelle+Halloween+photo.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;Dressed up for Halloween!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://www.sfcfarmersmarket.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=76&amp;amp;Itemid=102&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;Sustainable Food Center's Farmer's Market at Sunset Valle&lt;/a&gt;y, there are a few things I always buy:&amp;nbsp; milk from "Way Back When" dairy, whatever fruit is in season from several different farmers, and at least 2 -3 different types of vegetables from several different farmers.&amp;nbsp; The items I get every other week or so are goat cheese from &lt;a href="http://www.swedefarm.com/"&gt;Swede Farm&lt;/a&gt;, several different types of cow's cheese from &lt;a href="http://www.brazosvalleycheese.com/"&gt;Brazos Valley Cheese&lt;/a&gt;, and eggs (I rotate between &lt;a href="http://www.richardsonfarms.com/"&gt;Richardson Farm&lt;/a&gt;, Flintrock Hill Farm, and Hairston Creek Farm).&amp;nbsp; Remember, my husband and I are lacto-ovo vegetarian, not vegan.&amp;nbsp; We may make the switch eventually, but as long as I know the animals are being treated right and raised properly, I'm still o.k. with eating dairy and eggs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;Now, you are probably wondering "Is that why she is feeling so inspired?"&amp;nbsp; Actually, no.&amp;nbsp; Just a little while ago I was going through email when I saw this video that one of my colleagues posted: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;object height="385" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/KsP7IncdKv8?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/KsP7IncdKv8?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;What did you think?&amp;nbsp; WOW, was what I thought!&amp;nbsp; Where are these kids and where is this teacher?&amp;nbsp; Can I get them to come here and teach our kids to give up there Halloween candy for FRUITS and VEGETABLES???&amp;nbsp; I thought this video was awesome!&amp;nbsp; Not only are they eating healthy foods in place of candy, they are getting exercise and learning how to cook in the process!&amp;nbsp; This is pure genius. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;I hope you enjoyed the video, and are feeling just as inspired as I did!&amp;nbsp; Have a Happy, HEALTHY, Halloween!

		<title type='text'>Agave: Health Food, Health Fad or Health Fraud?  Part Two</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;As promised, here is part two of the blog on Agave.&amp;nbsp; I think this will answer a few more questions for you! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Two last points..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;A recent study in the journal Environmental Health (5), found mercury in nearly 50 percent of the tested samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). &amp;nbsp;A separate study by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) detected mercury in nearly one-third of 55 popular brandname food and beverage products where HFCS is the first or second highest labeled ingredient. &amp;nbsp;As the authors concluded, "With respect to total mercury exposure, it may be necessary to account for this source of mercury in the diet of children and sensitive populations."&amp;nbsp; This concern would only relate to HFCS and not Agave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;A recent study (6) measured the antioxidant acuity level of several sweeteners and found that refined sugar, corn syrup, and agave nectar contained minimal antioxidant activity, raw cane sugar was slightly higher, and dark and blackstrap molasses had the highest antioxidant activity. &amp;nbsp;Maple syrup, brown sugar, and honey showed intermediate antioxidant capacity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;So, lets put all of this in perspective...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Are higher levels of fructose in a concentrated caloric sweetener good or bad?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Well, if you think HFCS is bad because of the amount of fructose in it, then Agave must be much worse then HFCS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;If you think Agave syrup is good because it has a very low GI/GL, as a result of the fructose in it, than HFCS must not be that bad and at least better than table sugar because it has a higher level of fructose in it, and so would have a lower GI/GL than table sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;So again, are higher levels of fructose in a concentrated caloric sweetener good or bad?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;We just can't argue it both ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Now, as we see from these recent studies (1,2), fructose, in excess can create problems as it goes directly to the liver.&amp;nbsp; However, these problems only existed when excess was consumed as there were no negative effects when less than 50 grams was consumed, even when it was pure fructose. &amp;nbsp;So again, the real issue is quantity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;If it takes a minimum of 50 grams of fructose to see any negative effect and at least 100 grams of fructose to see a significant negative effect, lets see how these numbers related to potential intakes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;To ingest 50 grams fructose, this would be the equivalent of consuming either 100 grams of sucrose, as sucrose is 50/50 glucose/fructose and about 91 grams of HFCS, as HFCS is 55/45 fructose/glucose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;To ingest 100 grams of fructose, this would be the equivalent of either 200 grams of sucrose, as sucrose is 50/50 glucose/fructose and about 182 grams of HFCS, as HFCS is 55/45 fructose/glucose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;91 grams of HFCS is 370 calories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;100 grams of sucrose is 400 calories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;182 grams of HFCS is 740 calories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;200 grams of Sucrose is 800 calories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I think anyone would agree that 370 to 400 calories, or 740 to 800 calories of either one as part of daily diet would be considered excess. On a 2000 calorie diet, this would be 19% (at 370 calories) to 40% (at 800 calories) of someone's caloric intake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;So, the real issue again, is not which one, but the total amount. &amp;nbsp;The bottom line, no matter which one you choose to use, quantity is the real issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The recommendation I give in my Label Reading talk is to limit their consumption of all concentrated caloric sweeteners to no more than 5% of calories which for someone consuming 2000 calories is 100 calories per day which is 25 grams or about 2 tablespoons. The only exception I give is that if someone has elevated TGs, or at risk for CVD, then they may want to avoid those higher in fructose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Therefore, limit your consumption of all refined and/or concentrated sweeteners and if heart disease, elevated triglycerides, insulin resistance, diabetes and/or weight are concerns of yours, avoid the ones higher in fructose especially Agave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;1) Br J Nutr. 2008 Nov;100(5):947- 52. Consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages for 10 weeks increases postprandial triacylglycerol and apolipoprotein- B concentrations in overweight and obese women. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Fructose consumption in the USA has increased over the past three decades.&amp;nbsp; During this time, obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome have also increased in prevalence.&amp;nbsp; While diets high in fructose have been shown to promote insulin resistance and increase TAG concentrations in animals, there are insufficient data available regarding the long-term metabolic effects of fructose consumption in humans.&amp;nbsp; The objective of the present study was to investigate the metabolic effects of 10-week consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages in human subjects under energy-balanced conditions in a controlled research setting.&amp;nbsp; Following a 4-week weight-maintaining complex carbohydrate diet, seven overweight or obese (BMI 26.8-33.3 kg/m2) postmenopausal women were fed an isoenergetic intervention diet, which included a fructose-sweetened beverage with each meal, for 10 weeks.&amp;nbsp; The intervention diet provided 15% of energy from protein, 30% from fat and 55% from carbohydrate (30% complex carbohydrate, 25% fructose).&amp;nbsp; Fasting and postprandial glucose, insulin, TAG and apoB concentrations were measured.&amp;nbsp; Fructose consumption increased fasting glucose concentrations and decreased meal-associated glucose and insulin responses (P = 0.0002, P = 0.007 and P = 0.013, respectively).&amp;nbsp; Moreover, after 10 weeks of fructose consumption, 14 h postprandial TAG profiles were significantly increased, with the area under the curve at 10 weeks being 141% higher than at baseline (P = 0.04).&amp;nbsp; Fructose also increased fasting apoB concentrations by 19% (P = 0.043 v. baseline).&amp;nbsp; In summary, consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages increased postprandial TAG and fasting apoB concentrations, and the present results suggest that long-term consumption of diets high in fructose could lead to an increased risk of CVD.

Such effects are reported inconsistently.&amp;nbsp; OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effect of fructose on these health markers, particularly examining treatment dose and duration, and level of glycemic control.&amp;nbsp; DESIGN: A literature search was conducted for relevant randomized and controlled intervention studies of crystalline or pure fructose (excluding high-fructose corn syrup), data extraction, meta-analyses, and modeling using meta-regression.&amp;nbsp; RESULTS: Fructose intake &amp;lt; 90 g/d significantly improved HbA(1c) concentrations dependent on the dose, the duration of study, and the continuous severity of dysglycemia throughout the range of dysglycemia.&amp;nbsp; There was no significant change in body weight at intakes &amp;lt;100 g fructose/d.&amp;nbsp; Fructose intakes of &amp;lt;50 g/d had no postprandially significant effect on triacylglycerol and those of &lt;or=100g at="" d="" effect="" fasting.&amp;nbsp;="" had="" no="" significant="" subjects="" were="" when=""&gt;or=100 g fructose/d, the effect on fasting triacylglycerol depended on whether sucrose or starch was being exchanged with fructose, and the effect was dose-dependent but was less with increasing duration of treatment.&amp;nbsp; Different health types and sources of bias were examined; they showed no significant departure from a general trend.&amp;nbsp; CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis shows that fructose intakes from 0 to &amp;gt;or=90 g/d have a beneficial effect on HbA(1c).&amp;nbsp; Significant effects on postprandial triacylglycerols are not evident unless &amp;gt;50 g fructose/d is consumed, and no significant effects are seen for fasting triacylglycerol or body weight with intakes of &lt;or=100 18996880="" adults.="" d="" fructose="" g="" in="" pmid:=""&gt;&lt;/or=100&gt;&lt;/or=100g&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;3) J Agric Food Chem. 2009 Jul 31.

The data can be used by beekeepers to predict HMF formation on storage. Caged bee studies were conducted to evaluate the HMF dose-response effect on bee mortality.&amp;nbsp; Finally, commercial bases such as lime, potash, and caustic soda were added to neutralize hydronium ion in HMF samples, and the rates of HMF formation were compared at 45 degrees C.

Subjects on alternative nutrition do not use high temperature for culinary treatment and consume low amount of technologically processed food.&amp;nbsp; Fructation induced AGE fluorescence is greater as compared with that induced by glucose.&amp;nbsp; It is due to higher participation of a more reactive acyclic form of fructose.&amp;nbsp; Intake of vegetables and fruit with predominance of fructose is significantly higher in vegetarians.&amp;nbsp; Comparison of nutrition and plasma AGEs in vegetarian and omnivorous groups shows that the higher intake of fructose in alternative nutrition of healthy subjects may cause an increase of AGE levels.

Dark and blackstrap molasses had the highest FRAP (4.6 to 4.9 mmol/100 g), while maple syrup, brown sugar, and honey showed intermediate antioxidant capacity (0.2 to 0.7 mmol FRAP/100 g).&amp;nbsp; Based on an average intake of 130 g/day refined sugars and the antioxidant activity measured in typical diets, substituting alternative sweeteners could increase antioxidant intake an average of 2.6 mmol/day, similar to the amount found in a serving of berries or nuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Conclusion: Many readily available alternatives to refined sugar offer the potential benefit of antioxidant activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Agave: Health Food, Health Fad or Health Fraud?  Part One</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Agave is still getting a lot of press, and many people think it is a healthy alternative to white sugar.&amp;nbsp; But is it really?&amp;nbsp; A fellow RD, &lt;a href="http://www.jeffnovick.com/RD/Home.html"&gt;Jeff Novick&lt;/a&gt;, has written extensively on the topic.&amp;nbsp; With his permission, I am posting his findings as a "guest" blog, split into two parts.&amp;nbsp; Below is part one: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Agave has become the sweetener of choice for many health enthusiasts. It is appearing on store shelves everywhere, in many new products and being promoted in magazines and cooking shows.&amp;nbsp; One of the main benefits we hear is that it is lower in the glycemic index.&amp;nbsp; Is Agave really a health food and something you should be including in your diet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, but to understand why, let us take a closer look at the issues surrounding Agave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, to understand Agave, we have to understand some points about fructose which is the main form of sugar in Agave and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS).&amp;nbsp; Fructose is metabolized differently than other sugars.&amp;nbsp; Instead of going into the blood stream (where it could raise blood sugar), most of it goes directly to the liver.&amp;nbsp; This is why Fructose has a lower Glycemic index (GI) as the GI is based on a foods influence on blood sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While many promote this as a positive, as the consumption of fructose tends not to raise blood sugar, fructose, or any concentrated caloric sweeteners high in fructose, can cause elevated levels of triglycerides and increase someone’s risk for heart disease.&amp;nbsp; It may also somewhat increase the risk of metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance.&amp;nbsp; And these effects are most likely in those who are insulin resistant, and/or overweight and/or obese.&amp;nbsp; It also may not affect the satiety mechanism as well as pure sucrose. (1,2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, these are all many of the reasons we are being told to avoid High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) as it has a higher level of fructose than regular table sugar or regular corn syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the real irony in all of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this concern about the elevated levels of fructose in High Fructose Corn Syrup, some health food stores, will not carry any product that has HFCS in it.&amp;nbsp; Yet on the other hand, they carry a full line of Agave Syrup products on their shelf and carry many products sweetened with Agave syrup.&amp;nbsp; But realize that Agave syrup has a fructose content of about 70-90%, which is way higher (worse) than HFCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, consumers, especially the health conscious, are avoiding High Fructose Corn Syrup like the plague because the level of fructose in it is higher (55%) than in regular table sugar/sucrose (50%).&amp;nbsp; They consider the higher level of fructose a problem.&amp;nbsp; The fact that is has a lower GI than table sugar is ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, Agave syrup has become a popular sweetener because it is said to have a lower GI.&amp;nbsp; They consider this to be a health benefit.&amp;nbsp; The fact that it has the highest level of fructose than any other sweetener is ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, are higher levels of fructose in a concentrated caloric sweetener good or bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my perspective, the Glycemic index (and the glycemic load) are very poor indicators of how healthy a food is and I recommend avoiding choosing foods by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as Agave is being promoted because of its low Glycemic index, lets look at the Glycemic index issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GI (GL) Of Sugars/Sweeteners&lt;br /&gt;Fructose 13 (2)&lt;br /&gt;Sucrose 65 (7)&lt;br /&gt;Glucose 100 (10)&lt;br /&gt;Honey 61 (12) (depending on variety as ratio can be 35-74 for GI and 6-18 for the GL)&lt;br /&gt;Agave Syrup 13 (2) (depending on variety)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High Fructose Corn Syrup would be similar to a honey that has a similar fructose/glucose ratio as the composition and ratio would be the same.&amp;nbsp; So, let's say a GI of 45 (and a GL of 9) as a honey with the same ratio of fructose/glucose tested at 45 (and 9). HFCS has a lower GI (GL) than table sugar because of the higher level of fructose. So, the higher the percentage of fructose the lower the GI with pure fructose being the lowest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other concerns with HFCS and fructose and so potentially Agave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent study showed that when HFCS was exposed to warm temperatures, it forms hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), &amp;nbsp;a potentially dangerous toxic substance, and killed honeybees (3).&amp;nbsp; Some researchers believe that this chemical, HMF, &amp;nbsp;may be a factor in Colony Collapse Disorder, a mysterious disease that has killed at least one-third of the honeybee population in the United States. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the study, the scientists measured levels of HMF in HFCS products from different manufacturers over a period of 35 days at different temperatures.&amp;nbsp; As temperatures rose, levels of HMF increased steadily. &amp;nbsp;Levels jumped dramatically at about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. &amp;nbsp;They also mentioned other studies that have linked HMF to DNA damage in humans.&amp;nbsp; In addition, HMF breaks down in the body to other substances potentially more harmful than HMF. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The researchers said, "Because HFCS is incorporated as a sweetener in many processed foods, the data from this study are important for human health as well," the report states. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this study, it was the effect of heat on fructose that formed the toxic chemical, so heating anything high in fructose corn syrup (HFCS) should be a concern. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, remember, HFCS is about 55% Fructose and Agave syrup is about 70-90% fructose. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, heating Agave would potentially create more of this toxic chemical. &amp;nbsp;Another strike against HFCS, but a bigger strike against Agave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is more to the concern about heating fructose.&amp;nbsp; It turns out that when fructose is heated in can also create Advanced Glycogen End Products (AGEs), which may be harmful as they may play a role in development of atherosclerosis, diabetes, aging and chronic renal failure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One study compared the amount of AGEs formed between the subject following a traditional omnivorous diet and one following a more traditional vegetarian diet (4). &amp;nbsp;(NOTE: This was not the same type of vegetarian diet recommended here!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the authors found was that the AGEs levels were higher in the vegetarians.&amp;nbsp; Upon closer examination, they discovered that it was higher levels of fructose in the vegetarian diet that was the main contributor to the increased level of AGEs and stated, "Comparison of nutrition and plasma AGEs in vegetarian and omnivorous groups shows that the higher intake of fructose in alternative nutrition of healthy subjects may cause an increase of AGE levels."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the above study, most of the AGEs were formed from the fructose which came from honey. &amp;nbsp;As the authors stated, "Furthermore, the intake of honey is three times higher in vegetarians."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey has one of the higher concentrations of fructose out of many of the typical sweeteners available and is around 55% fructose depending on the variety. Agave is 70-90% fructose.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, substituting Agave for any other sweetener would make the above results (of a potential increase in AGEs) more likely to occur. &amp;nbsp;This is one more good reason to avoid Agave.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Come back next week to read part two! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

Celestial Arts, 2009; 189 pages; $25.00; ISBN 978-1-58761-348-7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Cybele Pascal is a food writer and has also authored &lt;i&gt;The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; She, her husband, and two sons all have various food allergies and missed many of their favorite treats; her answer was to develop &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Allergen-Free Baker’s Handbook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The book contains 100 vegan recipes for baked goods made without gluten, wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, or sesame. &lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Allergen-Free Baker’s Handbook&lt;/i&gt; starts with a chapter on stocking your pantry which describes types of flours, oils, chocolates, and other ingredients, and provides suggestions for brand names and stores.&amp;nbsp; Pascal also includes information on recommended kitchen tools and provides details on how to replace potential allergens. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The remaining chapters include recipes for muffins,  cookies, cakes, pies, yeasted baked goods, and savories.&amp;nbsp; A resource section provides information on food and  equipment sources and organizations providing support  for people with food allergies. With the rise in diagnosed food allergies, sensitivities, and intolerances, more consumers are in need of a resource like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Allergen-Free Baker’s Handbook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt; for occasions when they want to indulge in a treat. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The two recipes I tried (Snickerdoodles and Basic Scones) turned out good, not great; I could definitely tell they were gluten-free.&amp;nbsp; I’ll have to try them again with the superfine brown rice flour that she recommends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;(I wasn't able to locate the specific brand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;for my test batches) and see if they turn out better.&amp;nbsp; The only thing missing from this book is nutritional information for the recipes.&amp;nbsp; Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be able to bake a variety of foods and who must avoid gluten and other common allergens.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Reviewed by Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Coyote Creek Farm’s World’s Best Eggs!</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I’m afraid I’m a little late getting this blog up!&amp;nbsp; But as promised, here’s the scoop on this farm I toured back in May just up the road from Austin, Texas in a small town called Elgin.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This farm tour was actually organized by &lt;a href="http://slowfoodaustin.org/"&gt;Slow Food Austin&lt;/a&gt; as a fundraiser for the &lt;a href="http://www.tofga.org/"&gt;Texas Organic Farmers &amp;amp; Gardeners Association&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We were there specifically to tour Coyote Creek’s Organic Feed Mill and Egg Farm.&amp;nbsp; Prior to actually viewing the mill, Jeremiah Cunningham, the proprietor of Coyote Creek Farm, gave us some background information on how he came to be an organic farmer and feed mill operator.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most people, Jeremiah had a “corporate” business job for many years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He started to have significant health problems related to his high stress levels, lack of exercise, and poor eating habits, so he decided he had to make a change.&amp;nbsp; He gave up corporate America, bought some land in Elgin and decided to start an organic farm to improve his health. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was able to tour Joel Salatin’s &lt;a href="http://www.polyfacefarms.com/default.aspx"&gt;Polyface Farm&lt;/a&gt; in Virginia to start the learning process of how to farm sustainably.&amp;nbsp; (You may remember Joel Salatin as one of the farmer’s in the movie Food, Inc.).&amp;nbsp; Jeremiah also read many books and talked with many other people who practice “permaculture.”&amp;nbsp; (&lt;a href="http://www.permaculture.org/nm/index.php/site/classroom/"&gt;Permaculture&lt;/a&gt; is defined as an ecological system that is sustainable in all aspects.)&amp;nbsp; After doing all his research and starting to raise chickens and cattle, Jeremiah realized that he could not find a quality organic feed that was sourced in Texas, so he decided to start his own mill.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, other local farmers began to ask him if he would be willing to provide them with organic feed for their poultry as well.&amp;nbsp; That’s how his mill was born!&amp;nbsp; He also began to get demand for his eggs and beef.&amp;nbsp; This eventually caused Jeremiah to expand his farm and start producing for customers.&amp;nbsp; Luckily there were more acres of farmland right next to the land Jeremiah owned, so expansion was fairly easy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Once his chickens “retire” from egg-laying (which is when they are a little over two years of age), they are given to an animal rescue group who then re-homes the chickens.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TJFKzQzBBoI/AAAAAAAAAMw/_lqTh2qH0-Q/s1600/chickens+w+less+shadow.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TJFKzQzBBoI/AAAAAAAAAMw/_lqTh2qH0-Q/s320/chickens+w+less+shadow.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;It was really hot, so most of the chickens stayed in the shade!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;It’s great to see that a farmer can be big enough to sell through a store like Whole Foods and still be able to treat their animals humanely, be organic, and be sustainable.&amp;nbsp; In addition, Jeremiah Cunningham was able to improve his health so much that he is now a cancer survivor!&amp;nbsp; Jeremiah is truly an inspiration, and I am happy to have made his acquaintance.&amp;nbsp; Please support farmers like him, and check out his video below!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="385" width="480"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8q-pdMES7io?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8q-pdMES7io?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Afraid to Eat Eggs?</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;First, my sincere apologies for not having blogged in two months!&amp;nbsp; I cannot believe how quickly the summer went by.&amp;nbsp; On the plus side, my business is really picking up so I've been doing a lot of work with individual clients.&amp;nbsp; On the down side, I have discovered my time management skills need some work!&amp;nbsp; Having said that, starting in September I am making a concerted effort to get back on track with writing regular blogs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Now then, even though it has been several weeks since the news first broke about tainted eggs, it continues to be talked about in the media.&amp;nbsp; Just yesterday evening I was watching ABC World News with Diane Sawyer and again they were talking about filthy conditions discovered by inspectors at one of the Wright plants.&amp;nbsp; I have blogged before about knowing where your food comes from, and I think now is a good time to remind everyone why this is so important.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The story on the news last night really turned my stomach, for a number of reasons.&amp;nbsp; First of all, the fact that numerous rodents were freely running around in the hen house should have been red flag number one that conditions were not sanitary and just “washing” the eggs is not going to adequately ensure they are safe for human consumption.&amp;nbsp; Rampant flies in the area should have been red flag number two.&amp;nbsp; What comes to your mind when you think of a lot of flies congregating in a relatively small area?&amp;nbsp; Not a pleasant picture, at least not in my mind!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I think you all know by now that I am an animal lover, so seeing the conditions that those poor chickens are working in is what really turned my stomach (as if the items I’ve mentioned above were not enough!).&amp;nbsp; I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again:&amp;nbsp; We reap what we sow.&amp;nbsp; We cannot expect to pay pennies on the dollar for high quality food.&amp;nbsp; Something has to give, and in our current conventional factory farm system, the first to suffer are the animals.&amp;nbsp; However, suffering is not just limited to the animals; ask anyone who got salmonella poisoning how they feel.&amp;nbsp; This is a direct consequence of "doing things on the cheap."&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;This is a prime example of why I am more than willing to pay more for good quality food, particularly from local farmers that I can meet, talk to, and even visit their farms!&amp;nbsp; There is no better way to protect yourself from this type of outbreak than to know the source of your food.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;You can always go to your &lt;a href="http://www.localharvest.org/"&gt;local farmer's market&lt;/a&gt; and find sources of good quality eggs there.&amp;nbsp; However, I know that getting to the farmer's market can sometimes be a challenge.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;If you want a good source of eggs and you live in Texas, &lt;a href="http://www.coyotecreekfarm.org/home.php"&gt;Coyote Creek Farm&lt;/a&gt; in Elgin sells eggs under the name “World’s Best Eggs” through Whole Foods Market.&amp;nbsp; I have personally toured their farm and met the proprietor, Jeremiah Cunningham and can vouch for the safety and sanitation of their operation!&amp;nbsp; In fact, I will dedicate my next blog to my tour of their property this past summer, so stay tuned!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Cycling and Leg Cramps (It’s not just about Hydration!)</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;You may recall, I did some traveling in May for vacation.&amp;nbsp; I don’t know about you, but whenever I go on vacation it always seems like I have to work extra hard both before (to get ready for it), and after (to catch up from being away).&amp;nbsp; For that reason, I did not get on my bike as much as I usually do.&amp;nbsp; I think I may have had one 20ish mile ride a couple of weeks before and a couple of weeks after vacation, which put me into early June with only a couple of bike rides.&amp;nbsp; Don’t worry, did not completely fall off the exercise wagon!&amp;nbsp; I was still getting in runs, swims, and some core workouts.&amp;nbsp; For me I can get a good workout in only one hour in those 3 areas, but with cycling it needs to be at least a couple of hours, which is not going to happen unless I have time to ride at least 30+ miles.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Well, a couple of weekends ago a group of “recreational cyclists” that I occasionally tag along with posted a 40ish mile route that I had not done before.&amp;nbsp; It sounded like fun, so I decided to go for it, even though I had only been on my bike twice in the previous month, and only for short rides.&amp;nbsp; The first half was great!&amp;nbsp; We started at about 7:45 a.m. and the wind was at our back for 20 miles.&amp;nbsp; We stopped at a small general store in a little town called Andice.&amp;nbsp; There we had potty breaks and refueled.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The way back was not pretty!&amp;nbsp; All those long rolling hills that we sped down we now had to ride UP, into a very strong headwind!&amp;nbsp; Our group quickly split in two, but I managed to hang on to the back of wheel of the first group until we hit about mile 30.&amp;nbsp; That’s when I found myself in no man’s land.&amp;nbsp; My left leg had been spasming for some time already, but I had managed to keep it from completely cramping by pulling harder with my right leg.&amp;nbsp; That turned out to not be such a good strategy because once I got on the biggest hill, my right leg started cramping up severely.&amp;nbsp; I can honestly say I have never in my life had leg cramps that bad!&amp;nbsp; It got so bad I could not pedal and had to jump off my bike for a few minutes and just stand on the side of the road.&amp;nbsp; Eventually I was able to move my legs a little, so I walked a bit before hoping back on my bike and slowly making my way back to a couple of members of the group that had waited for me at the top of the next hill.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Let me tell you, I was definitely not dehydrated, and I was not low on electrolytes.&amp;nbsp; I know, we are in the middle of summer in Texas, but I had already consumed at least 20 ounces of fluid that contained over 600 mg of potassium and sodium (plus other minerals), and another 400 mg in a nutrition bar at the rest stop, plus at least 20 ounces of additional water.&amp;nbsp; I was able to confirm my hydration status once I got home and weighed (no change), and checked my urine (pale yellow, so had not overhydrated with water).&amp;nbsp; So what caused my leg cramps?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I am guessing a couple of things.&amp;nbsp; One, lack of fitness on the bike.&amp;nbsp; I probably could have ridden an easy 40 miles with no problem even though I had only a couple of short rides the previous month, but since this ride had a lot of hills and a strong headwind (and later I realized my brake was rubbing) my legs just were not ready.&amp;nbsp; The second thing was probably bad technique.&amp;nbsp; Once my left leg started giving me grief, I did not maintain equal pressure all the way around my stroke with both legs.&amp;nbsp; By pulling unevenly, I stressed my right leg so much that it started cramping as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;So if you are suffering from leg cramps, it is probably just not one thing.&amp;nbsp; Evaluate your hydration status, your electrolyte intake, AND your technique!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Happy cycling!&amp;nbsp;

		<title type='text'>My Review of Brazier's Thrive Fitness</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;You probably don't know this, but I am the current book reviewer for &lt;i&gt;Vegetarian Nutrition Update&lt;/i&gt;, which is a newsletter published by the Vegetarian Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group - a part of the American Dietetic Association.&amp;nbsp; I mention it because this week I would like to post my recently published review of Brendan Brazier's most recent book &lt;i&gt;Thrive Fitness&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; He is touring the US, and this Sunday through Tuesday (June 12th through June 15th) he is going to be in Austin, TX making appearances at several natural foods type stores.&amp;nbsp; So without further adieu, below is my review.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thrive Fitness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Brendan Brazier. Da Capo Press, 2009; 245 pages; $15.95; ISBN 978-0-7382-1362-0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brendan Brazier is a professional ironman triathlete and vegan.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Thrive Fitness&lt;/i&gt; is a follow up to his first book, &lt;i&gt;Thrive&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Thrive&lt;/i&gt; was primarily a diet-focused book, while &lt;i&gt;Thrive Fitness&lt;/i&gt; takes a more holistic approach in instructing the reader how to gain strength, prevent disease and become more fit and &amp;nbsp;healthier.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Thrive Fitness&lt;/i&gt; is divided into four main sections, with a total of eight chapters.&amp;nbsp; In the first section “What Happened to Our Health?” Brazier describes the current obesity epidemic and factors that contribute to this epidemic.&amp;nbsp; He supports his statements with information from reputable sources including the Centers for Disease Control, the American Heart Association, and medical journals.&amp;nbsp; In the second section, “What is Thrive Fitness?” he explains concepts such as “high-return exercise,” “high net-gain nutrition,” the importance of quality sleep, and stress reduction.&amp;nbsp; I found this to be a very useful section in explaining how to best select what type of physical activity to choose in order to get the most out of it and prevent over-training syndrome.&amp;nbsp; I also liked the way Brazier explained high net-gain nutrition and how this can lower physical stress on our bodies by avoiding foods that would provide little nutrition yet require our bodies to work harder to process them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Training, Living, and Improving” is the third section and gives tips on the mental aspects of training as well as disease prevention.&amp;nbsp; My only concern in this section is when he talks about “bad” LDL cholesterol and states, “only animal products contain this type of cholesterol.” This may lead the reader to think that plant foods contain the “good” type of cholesterol, whereas plants do not contain any type of cholesterol.&amp;nbsp; The last section “Achieving and Maintaining Thrive Fitness” details starting his 6-week training plan and includes nutrients to focus on, recipes, shopping lists, a sample menu, training logs, and a Q &amp;amp; A section.&amp;nbsp; As an ACSM Certified Health Fitness Specialist, my main concern with this section was a description of how to do bench dips that may actually cause shoulder injury; having your upper body so far away from the bench (as described and shown in the photo) has been shown to put a significant amount of strain on the shoulder. One limitation of the book is that recipes do not include any nutritional information. Despite a few concerns, I highly recommend this book to those who want to improve their health and fitness level while at the same time following a vegan diet. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Christine E.

		<title type='text'>The Omnivore’s Dilemma - a Review</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;As you may recall in my previous blog, I recently read &lt;i&gt;The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals&lt;/i&gt; by Michael Pollan.&amp;nbsp; If you have not read it, I highly recommend it.&amp;nbsp; The book is broken into 3 sections:&amp;nbsp; Industrial/Corn, Pastoral/Grass, and Personal/Forest.&amp;nbsp; Each section is further broken down into several chapters.&amp;nbsp; It includes some tough chapters on animal slaughter and factory farms, but that is only part of the book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TAa6lxXqxwI/AAAAAAAAAK8/NQNzTnCEJJ0/s1600/OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/TAa6lxXqxwI/AAAAAAAAAK8/NQNzTnCEJJ0/s320/OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Section one starts out giving a history lesson on corn and the many products in this country that have corn as some sort of ingredient.&amp;nbsp; It also details how this tremendous crop has become the bane of many farmers’ existence.&amp;nbsp; I actually learned a few things that I didn’t already know regarding the vicious cycle of corn farming in America.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;In section two, Pollan spends a week working on Polyface farm in Virginia.&amp;nbsp; For those of you who saw Food, Inc., this is Joel Salatin’s farm where all the animals are allowed to practice their natural behaviors, spend most of their time “free on the range,” and are fed their natural diet.&amp;nbsp; I have a lot of respect for Pollan actually experiencing the hard work that farmers like Joel Salatin go through.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Pollan wraps up the book with section three, in which he debates the ethics of eating animals, experiences hunting wild pig and foraging for wild mushrooms, and prepares an entire meal from scratch using items he obtained in his section three “adventures.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I really appreciated the effort he put into “tracking” a particular food item from its start to where it may ultimately end up, whether it was corn from a large industrial farm, a steer in a factory farm, or a pig on a family farm.&amp;nbsp; He does a good job of including virtually all aspects of our food supply system.&amp;nbsp; As the title implies, he also contrasts four meals:&amp;nbsp; a fast food meal in section one, an “organic industrial meal” purchased from Whole Foods in section two, a home cooked meal made from non-factory farmed “grass-fed” foods - which were fresh ingredients from Polyface Farm - also in section two, and another home cooked meal made from a combination of foods he foraged for, hunted, or grew in his own garden in section three. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;At the end of the book, he includes all the sources he used in writing this piece and includes his website address.&amp;nbsp; His &lt;a href="http://www.michaelpollan.com/link.htm"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has many useful links, such as resources for sustainable eating, resources for gardeners/farmers/ranchers, and many more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;If you care about your health and the health of your family, I highly encourage you to read this book and learn more about where your food comes from. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>The Vegetarian’s Dilemma</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I just got back from a week of vacation with my husband down on the Texas coast; Port Aransas to be specific.&amp;nbsp; It was great!&amp;nbsp; The water was surprisingly clean, temperatures not too hot, and sunny all but one day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S_6U6JAOAJI/AAAAAAAAAK0/Mk4yEUb8QEs/s1600/Port+A+beach.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S_6U6JAOAJI/AAAAAAAAAK0/Mk4yEUb8QEs/s320/Port+A+beach.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Anytime we travel, I usually try to research food options ahead of time, particularly since we are vegetarian.&amp;nbsp; I did for this trip as well, but had limited success because many of the restaurants in Port Aransas do not have websites.&amp;nbsp; Of the few restaurants who had websites, not many had vegetarian options, hence the name of this blog!&amp;nbsp; Even so, it really was not a big deal since we stayed in a condo and prepared most of our own meals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;However, there were a few restaurant options we tried.&amp;nbsp; Shell’s Pasta and Seafood had 4 different vegetarian pasta dishes available on their dinner menu, as well as a couple of different appetizers and desserts. We ate dinner there one evening in which we split an appetizer, had our own (different) entrées, and split dessert.&amp;nbsp; It was very good; all together, including a couple of glasses of wine, was only $40. Our waitress said they had a different lunch menu, but we did not have a chance to go back and check it out.&amp;nbsp; I would definitely go back to this restaurant.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The Venetian Hot Plate only had one vegetarian entrée (pasta), a couple of appetizers and a couple of salads.&amp;nbsp; We ate dinner there one night; it was o.k., but because of the very limited variety and high cost, I would not go back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Port A Pizzeria had lots of options (sandwiches, pizza, a salad bar and buffet) but we did not actually eat there.&amp;nbsp; We did eat a vegetarian pizza at the Port A Brewery, which if I recall correctly was the only vegetarian “meal” option available there at lunch/dinner. However, they did also have vegetarian desserts.&amp;nbsp; It was good, average in cost, and we did go back on our last day to get some cinnamon rolls to go!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Overall, if you plan to stay in Port A for a whole week and are vegetarian or vegan, I recommend staying some place where you can prepare some of your own meals so you do not get bored eating the same things daily!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Besides researching places to eat, whenever I take a “beach” vacation, I always pack a few books to read.&amp;nbsp; This trip’s selection included one book purely for enjoyment, one for learning more about our food supply, and one about fitness.&amp;nbsp; Usually I can finish 3 books in a week, but this time I lacked about 50 pages to finish my last one (the book about fitness).&amp;nbsp; Oh well, guess I spent more time than usual napping and playing in the water!&amp;nbsp; I started with the “pure enjoyment” book, which was about dogs, and finished it in the first two days of the trip.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;br style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;My second book, &lt;i&gt;The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals&lt;/i&gt; by Michael Pollan, was a bit heavier and took me three days to finish.&amp;nbsp; I was so impressed by this book that my next blog is going to be entirely about that book, so stay tuned!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I recently read a book called &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; by Jonathan Safran Foer.&amp;nbsp; I already knew what goes on in factory farming from reports I have seen on the evening news, videos put out by various "animals' rights" organizations, and the movie &lt;i&gt;Food, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;, however, this book went into a lot more depth than anything I had previously been exposed to.&amp;nbsp; It was a very difficult book to read, but as a "nutrition professional," something I felt I needed to do.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I know a lot of people may not be that concerned about animals' rights, but everyone ought to be concerned about "human rights" and what eating factory farmed meat can do to your health.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I really appreciated the extensive list of references in the "Notes" section of this book because it allows the reader to go and verify the information he writes about. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;For example, according to an article published by the &lt;a href="http://www.nasdonline.org/document/1836/d001772/human-health-effects-of-agriculture-physical-diseases-and.html"&gt;National Ag Safety Database:&lt;/a&gt; "Farmers have an increased prevalence of many acute and chronic health conditions including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, arthritis, skin cancer, hearing loss, and amputations."&amp;nbsp; This article goes on to say that research is lacking in a lot of areas regarding agriculture and human health, particularly in its present state.&amp;nbsp; However, there is quite a bit of research regarding respiratory diseases from exposures to organic dusts such as grain processing and Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs, also known as "factory farms").&amp;nbsp; For both swine and poultry CAFOs, there is mounting evidence that endotoxins found in organic dust cause many respiratory diseases in farm workers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;There are many potential pollutants associated with conventional agricultural production, such as fine particulates from diesel engines, pesticides, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides from fertilized fields and internal combustion engines, methane from dairy cows, and other volatile organic compounds from animal manure.&amp;nbsp; People living in the surrounding areas can have their health affected by these pollutants.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production (IFAP) has put together a report called &lt;a href="http://www.ncifap.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Putting Meat on The Table: Industrial Farm Animal Production in America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that details how the current system evolved and its impact on public health, environmental risks, animal welfare, rural America, and gives recommendations for a more sustainable system with fewer negative consequences.&amp;nbsp; One of the first negative examples given is regarding animal waste; it is usually left untreated (or minimally treated) or sprayed on fields as fertilizer.&amp;nbsp; Animal wastes contain many pathogens and chemicals, which can potentially contaminate the surrounding air, water, and soil.&amp;nbsp; In 2006, the CDC determined that an E. Coli outbreak in which 200 people were sickened and three people died was likely caused by animal runoff from an IFAP. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The Pew report goes on to summarize public health concerns related to IFAP as: higher risks of pathogens passing from animals to humans, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes (due primarily to the widespread use of antibiotics and anti-microbials in animals), food-borne illness, worker health concerns, and "dispersed impacts on the adjacent community at large."&amp;nbsp; These "dispersed impacts" fall into two main categories: 1) respiratory symptoms, disease, and impaired function (such as asthma), and 2) neurobehavioral symptoms and impaired function (such as depression, anger, confusion, fatigue, and impaired balance, memory, and intellectual function).&amp;nbsp; I encourage you to go to their website and read either the Executive summary or download the report in its entirety.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Mistreating animals meant for human consumption through the use of factory farms (by confining them to tight quarters, preventing them from practicing their "normal" behaviors, feeding them an un-natural diet, etc.) is ultimately causing preventable health problems in the people who are working with them, eating them, and living near them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I know, that is a lot of bad news!&amp;nbsp; So what can we do?&amp;nbsp; Plenty!&amp;nbsp; First of all, as consumers we can "vote with our dollars," meaning we can purchase foods produced by farmers/ranchers who use sustainable methods.&amp;nbsp; Check out this &lt;a href="http://www.eatwellguide.org/i.php?pd=Home"&gt;"Eat well guide"&lt;/a&gt; to find restaurants, farms, bakeries, etc. that use sustainably produced products in your area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;We can also advocate for better environmental and animal welfare regulations of farms.&amp;nbsp; Most importantly, educate yourself.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/issues/airpollution/#fn1"&gt;Sustainable Table&lt;/a&gt; is a great website with a lot of information on food production.&amp;nbsp; Learn where your food comes from and what goes into producing it.&amp;nbsp; Any business person will tell you consumer demand is what drives the markets; let's demand sustainably produced food! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Increase Physical Fitness and Follow a Plant-based Diet to Lower Your Cancer Risk</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;You may recall from my previous blog that I recently attended the &lt;st2:placename w:st="on"&gt;American&lt;/st2:placename&gt; &lt;st2:placetype w:st="on"&gt;College&lt;/st2:placetype&gt; of Sports Medicine’s Health Fitness Summit here in &lt;st2:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st2:city w:st="on"&gt;Austin&lt;/st2:city&gt;, &lt;st2:state w:st="on"&gt;TX&lt;/st2:state&gt;&lt;/st2:place&gt; about a week ago.&amp;nbsp; I was able to attend many useful sessions on nutrition and fitness, including one on how to lower cancer risk through physical activity and diet.&amp;nbsp; Because &lt;st1:givenname w:st="on"&gt;April&lt;/st1:givenname&gt; is Cancer Awareness Month, I’d like to highlight some of the recommendations from that session.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;This workshop gave us 10 recommendations for lowering your overall Cancer risk.&amp;nbsp; These recommendations come from the second World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) Expert report &lt;i&gt;Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You can &lt;a href="http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/"&gt;access the complete report here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Eight of the recommendations are for everyone and the last two are for special populations (women who are breast feeding and cancer survivors).&amp;nbsp; Listed below are the recommendations:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1"&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Be as lean as possible      within the normal range of body weight.” “Normal range” refers to ranges      defined by national governments or the World Health Organization.&amp;nbsp; For example, using BMI the lowest      “normal” BMI is 19, which is calculated by dividing your weight in kg by      your height in meters squared. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Be physically active as      part of everyday life.”&amp;nbsp; This is      defined as at least 30 minutes daily of moderate activity, which is      equated to brisk walking.&amp;nbsp; For      people who are already fit, 60 minutes daily of moderate activity or 30      minutes daily of vigorous activity is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Limit consumption of      energy-dense foods.&amp;nbsp; Avoid sugary      drinks.”&amp;nbsp; Energy-dense foods are      defined as foods that have 225-275 calories per 100 grams.&amp;nbsp; This recommendation also refers      specifically to “processed foods,” not naturally energy-dense foods such      as nuts/seeds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Eat mostly foods of plant      origin.”&amp;nbsp; This is specifically      referring to getting a majority of your calories from fruits and      non-starchy vegetables, although starchy vegetables, whole grains, nuts,      and seeds are also recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Limit intake of red meat      and avoid processed meat.” Red      meat is defined as beef, pork, lamb, and goat from domesticated animals      including that contained in processed foods.&amp;nbsp; No more than 18 ounces per week is what      is recommended.&amp;nbsp; “Processed meat” is      defined as meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of      chemical preservatives, and the recommendation is ideally to avoid      completely.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Limit alcoholic drinks.”&amp;nbsp;      This means two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for      women (which takes into account the possible cardio protective benefits of      alcohol).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Limit consumption of      salt.&amp;nbsp; Avoid moldy cereals (grains)      or pulses (legumes).”&amp;nbsp; Aim for less      than 2.4 grams of sodium daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;“Aim to meet nutritional      needs through diet alone.”&amp;nbsp; For most      people, supplements are not recommended specifically for cancer      prevention.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;First special population      recommendation: “Mothers to breastfeed.”&amp;nbsp;      Children should be breast fed for six months.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;Second special population recommendation:      “Cancer Survivors: Follow the recommendations for cancer prevention.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;If you visit the website and download “Chapter 12” (which gives details on the recommendations), you will see a chart that shows different types of cancer and diet and lifestyle factors and their effect on lowering or increasing the risk of developing those specific types of cancer.&amp;nbsp; Of all the items listed, alcohol and body fatness had the biggest impacts on increasing cancer risks.&amp;nbsp; Alcohol can increase the risk of developing 5 different types of cancer, and excess body fat can increase the risk of developing 6 different types of cancer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Physical activity and consuming fruits and non-starchy vegetables had the most impact on decreasing risk of developing cancer (3, 4, and 3 different types of cancers, respectively).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;So make sure you follow these recommendations!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

the last half of the week I attended my first “American College of Sports Medicine Health &amp;amp; Fitness Summit” (which means VERY long days), including the first part of Saturday, followed by a farm tour of Springdale Farm (located in the actual CITY of Austin), followed by 6 hours of Krav Maga Self Defense training.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I have so many things to share, it was hard for me to decide what to blog about this week, so I may end up posting two!&amp;nbsp; We’ll start today with my tour of the &lt;a href="http://springdalefarmaustin.com/"&gt;Springdale Farm&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This is another local farm that is actually located in the City of Austin, practically downtown!&amp;nbsp; Paula and Glenn Foore are the wife and husband duo that run this farm, along with volunteers and employees from their landscaping business. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;The Farm is 5 acres, and is primarily a vegetable farm, but they also have chickens (and therefore fresh eggs).&amp;nbsp; They have just acquired “runner ducks” and will soon have duck eggs as well. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

One of the things they do is plant flowers in the vegetable garden areas to help increase pollination, as well as spare the food crops from some bugs (some flowers are known to “repel” certain types of insects).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S8OK3YC1x6I/AAAAAAAAAKU/4G8oRl36Vmg/s1600/flowers+in+garden.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S8OK3YC1x6I/AAAAAAAAAKU/4G8oRl36Vmg/s400/flowers+in+garden.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may recall in my &lt;a href="http://marquettenutrition.blogspot.com/2010/03/touring-local-dairy-farm.html"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about Stryk Dairy how excited I was to have a local dairy source.&amp;nbsp; Well, I am now equally excited to have a local chicken egg source!&amp;nbsp; There are several different types of chickens at Springdale Farm; I asked Farmer Paula and she rattled off the names (there were too many for me to remember, and I didn’t have a pen &amp;amp; paper handy, sorry!) and described how the eggs look different from each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S8OLN7HEwMI/AAAAAAAAAKc/52-8PwwogXk/s1600/aggie+coop.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="357" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S8OLN7HEwMI/AAAAAAAAAKc/52-8PwwogXk/s400/aggie+coop.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S8OLbBGhbJI/AAAAAAAAAKk/qlU_Uu8TQ3Q/s1600/chickens.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S8OLbBGhbJI/AAAAAAAAAKk/qlU_Uu8TQ3Q/s400/chickens.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I found it quite funny that Paula and Glenn both mentioned that on the farm, the animals have multiple jobs.&amp;nbsp; The chickens not only provide eggs, but also manure for fertilizer, as well as entertainment!&amp;nbsp; Farmer Glenn specifically said the chickens are very good stress relievers; they are always happy to see him and never talk back!&amp;nbsp; The hope for the runner ducks is that they will eat bugs in the garden (since they are not fond of vegetables; the chickens will eat the vegetables if left to roam in the garden areas!), as well as supply eggs.&amp;nbsp; It was good to hear how much Paula and Glenn care about their animals.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;They are a small CSA, and also have a small “farm stand” on site Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.&amp;nbsp; This is a time when anyone can stop buy and purchase fresh eggs and vegetables.&amp;nbsp; Right now they are growing broccoli, leaf lettuce, head lettuce, cauliflower, cabbage, Swiss chard, beets, spinach, collard greens, arugula, turnips, carrots, cilantro, basil, chives, chamomile, fennel, parsley, marjoram, thyme, dill, scallions, garlic, shallots, onions, Brussel sprouts, rutabaga, mustard green, Chinese cabbage, Napa cabbage, lavender, oregano, turnips, parsnips, and more.&amp;nbsp; I was able to take home half a dozen fresh eggs, spinach, scallions, leeks, some herbs and a little lavender plant as part of my “tour.” I must say, everything tasted wonderful!&amp;nbsp; Yesterday I made spinach omelets with jalapeño cheddar cheese and scallions and they turned out super yummy (everything but the salt and pepper was from local farms!).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;If I haven’t convinced you already, I HIGHLY encourage you to become a member of a local CSA or shop at your local farmer’s market.&amp;nbsp; You can’t beat the quality!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<content type='html'>&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;Many of you know that I am a lacto-ovo vegetarian, meaning I eat dairy products and eggs, but do not eat any meat.&amp;nbsp; I was never a big dairy fan as a kid, but would use milk for cereal.&amp;nbsp; I acquired a taste for cheese as a teenager, for yogurt as a young adult, and still use milk primarily for cereal or in cooking.&amp;nbsp; Even though I now like a lot of dairy products, I have toyed with the idea of becoming vegan primarily for ethical reasons.&amp;nbsp; Ever since I saw the movie Food, Inc., I have been on a mission to learn as much as I can about where my food comes from, and buy only from sources that I trust.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;This past Saturday I had the privilege of touring &lt;a href="http://www.texascheese.com/index.htm"&gt;Stryk Jersey Farm&lt;/a&gt;, which is a family-run dairy farm just outside of &lt;st1:city w:st="on"&gt;Schulenberg&lt;/st1:city&gt;, &lt;st1:state w:st="on"&gt;TX&lt;/st1:state&gt; (about 82 miles southeast of &lt;st2:givenname w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Austin&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st2:givenname&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Once again &lt;a href="http://slowfoodaustin.org/"&gt;Slow Food Austin&lt;/a&gt; organized this tour. The Stryk Jersey Farm currently has between 50 and 100 &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Jersey&lt;/st1:place&gt; dairy cows.&amp;nbsp; They sell raw milk, butter, cottage cheese, and cheddar cheese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

This farm was his parents’, and he was born and raised here.&amp;nbsp; His parents were commercial dairy farmers back when families ran all commercial dairy farms. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;st2:givenname w:st="on"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;Bob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/st2:givenname&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt; went off to college with the intention of eventually taking over the family farm.&amp;nbsp; When he graduated and was ready to take over the farm, things had changed.&amp;nbsp; Farmers were being told, “Get big or get out.”&amp;nbsp; So, &lt;st2:givenname w:st="on"&gt;Bob&lt;/st2:givenname&gt; tried to get big, but found the industry was not what he bargained for.&amp;nbsp; Now severely in debt, he and his wife sold most of their cows and decided to “get jobs in town.”&amp;nbsp; They still hung onto their land and a few animals while deciding what to do.&amp;nbsp; After some time, they found out from a friend and fellow farmer that it is legal in &lt;st1:state w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Texas&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; to sell raw milk, and there was a demand for it, but it could not be sold in stores (therefore no commercial farmers would get into it).&amp;nbsp; After some research, inspections, and applying for the necessary permits and licenses, they became dairy farmers once again, now selling raw milk and cheese products.&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;After a little more information on the milking and cheese making process, we were free to “make ourselves at home” and wander around the farm, which is exactly what I did.&amp;nbsp; I was able to meet some “baby cows” as well as the herd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

The babies are bottle fed with their mother’s milk rather than allowed to feed off of their mothers in order to prevent any types of infection or contamination of the milk supply.&amp;nbsp; Once the babies have gotten all of their vaccinations and can safely be around the other cows, they are allowed into the pasture with the herd. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;The cows spend most of their time outside grazing.&amp;nbsp; About half of them are on the “wet pasture” (meaning they are currently producing milk) and half are on the “dry pasture” (meaning they are recovering, which is for a minimum of 2 months, but usually closer to 4 months).&amp;nbsp; The milk-producing cows are milked twice a day in “the milking room,” and each session takes about 10 minutes.&amp;nbsp; This room holds about 12 cows at a time (I regret I didn’t take a picture of it!).&amp;nbsp; The cows are not milked by hand; after farmer &lt;st2:givenname w:st="on"&gt;Bob&lt;/st2:givenname&gt; washes them up, they are hooked up to a machine that does the milking.&amp;nbsp; The cows actually enjoy being milked because they are able to eat a tasty treat during the process!&amp;nbsp; It is some sort of alfalfa pellet that they really enjoy.&amp;nbsp; I guess they like having something other than clover and grass to eat on occasion! &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;Even though both of my parents spent time on farms (my Dad grew up on a farm and was a member of Future Farmers of America – FFA), I did not spend a lot of time out on my Grandparents’ farm, and never had “fresh” milk or cheese.&amp;nbsp; All of the dairy I used came from the store and was pasteurized!&amp;nbsp; During this tour, we were going to have the opportunity to sample raw milk and cheese.&amp;nbsp; I have to admit, I was a little nervous about sampling these products.&amp;nbsp; In our culture, everything is so “sanitized” that many of us think “raw” products could potentially be dangerous. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;Properly handled raw milk from healthy cows does not pose any risk to consumers drinking it.&amp;nbsp; In fact, some people believe it is actually much healthier for you as it contains beneficial bacteria (similar to yogurt).&amp;nbsp; In addition, because the cows are allowed to be outside and graze on their “natural” diet, they rarely get sick, which means they do not need to be “fed” antibiotics the way traditional dairy cows are.&amp;nbsp; If a cow does get sick and has to have antibiotics, that cow’s milk is kept out of the dairy supply.&amp;nbsp; Plus, in order to sell raw milk, they are inspected almost daily by the Texas Health Department to ensure all the cows are healthy and free from harmful bacteria (which is much more frequent than commercial dairies).&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;I am so glad I tasted not only the cheese, but the milk as well.&amp;nbsp; That was the best tasting milk I have ever had in my life!&amp;nbsp; I could easily drink that milk as a beverage and not just have it on cereal or use to cook with.&amp;nbsp; If you are anywhere near the area, I highly encourage you to look them up and tour their farm.&amp;nbsp; Unless I am able to find another dairy farm that is even closer and treats its herd just as well, I believe Stryk Jersey Farm will be the primary supplier of dairy products in the &lt;st1:city w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st2:sn w:st="on"&gt;Marquette&lt;/st2:sn&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; household for as long as we continue to eat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;dairy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Health Care Reform Starts With You</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I recently attended the Texas Dietetic Association’s (TDA) Food and Nutrition Conference &amp;amp; Exhibition (FNCE).&amp;nbsp; This year it was held in Dallas.&amp;nbsp; There were several excellent workshops and presentations, as well as culinary demonstrations and vendor expos.&amp;nbsp; One of the most engaging presentations was our opening session. Some of you may be familiar with the speaker we had, Dr. Michael Roizen.&amp;nbsp; He is a good friend of Mehmet Oz (also known as Oprah’s doctor, who now has his own TV show).&amp;nbsp; Dr. Roizen is also the medical director of the &lt;a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/wellness/default.aspx"&gt;Cleveland Clinic’s wellness program&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title of Dr. Roizen’s presentation was “YOU and Your Genes: How Lifestyle and Foods Change Everything.”&amp;nbsp; During Dr. Roizen’s talk, he showed a clip of one of Dr. Oz’s shows where they put a meat-eating Cowboy named Rocco on a vegan diet for 28 days due to his extremely blocked arteries (over 95%), and diabetes.&amp;nbsp; His results were amazing.&amp;nbsp; In those 28 days, he lost 6 inches from his waist, dropped his fasting blood sugar from 179 to 99, and raised his healthy HDL cholesterol from 33 to 45.&amp;nbsp; Those are extremely dramatic results in just 4 weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FKYPSPUQvr4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FKYPSPUQvr4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as a dietitian, I am well aware of the fact that food can have the effects seen in Rocco.&amp;nbsp; What I didn’t realize was how dramatically food can effect all of our genes.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Roizen also had lots of data regarding how diet can effectively turn “on” and “off” certain types of genes.&amp;nbsp; One very telling slide he showed was regarding prostate cancer.&amp;nbsp; He showed a slide of men who ate a typical American diet, and how many of their “cancer” genes were turned on, while the genes that kill these cancer causers were turned off.&amp;nbsp; When these men changed their diet to avoid what Dr. Roizen refers to as the top 5 worst foods (saturated fat, trans fat, simple sugars, syrup, and refined grains), they were able to turn off the cancer causing genes and turn on the cancer-killing genes.&amp;nbsp; Absolutely amazing data!&amp;nbsp; This means that we do not have to be a victim of our “genes,” we absolutely have control over preventing the vast majority of chronic diseases (including type 2 diabetes).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One disheartening piece of data he showed was that if you “indulge” in one of these top 5 “bad” foods, it can take between 7 and 21 days to recover.&amp;nbsp; That speaks volumes of how important it is to eat a healthy diet consistently, and avoiding those “cheat” days.&amp;nbsp; I know for me personally, I rarely eat “junk” food, and when on occasion I do, pay dearly for it!&amp;nbsp; My stomach will ache, sometimes eczema on my hands will flair up, I may get a headache. . . in short, I just plain feel lousy!&amp;nbsp; Then I ask myself, “Was it really worth it?”&amp;nbsp; For me, there is not any food worth feeling bad for!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other interesting data Dr. Roizen showed was comparisons of Americans and Europeans.&amp;nbsp; I was not going to mention this, but with all the recent Health-care Reform hoopla, I saw a person holding a sign that said: “We don’t want to be Europeans.”&amp;nbsp; Well, Europeans have lower rates of virtually every type of chronic disease than Americans (by half or more).&amp;nbsp; Hmm. . . maybe those Europeans know a thing or two more than we do!&amp;nbsp; They are definitely much healthier than we are as a country.&amp;nbsp; Could it be that they exercise more?&amp;nbsp; Could it be that they eat less?&amp;nbsp; Could it be that they eat healthier?&amp;nbsp; Who knows, but one thing is for sure, we as a society need to start making healthier choices ourselves or we are headed for a lower quality of life, as well as a lower lifespan due to physical pain (e.g. joint pain) from being obese, diabetes, heart disease, various types of cancer, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Roizen has authored several books, including the newly revised “YOU On a Diet,” and works with several registered dietitians in his clinic.&amp;nbsp; He, along with Dr. Oz and several of their colleagues, will be holding a health symposium called “Food for your Whole Life” this June in New York, NY.&amp;nbsp; One day is geared toward the general public, while another day is geared toward healthcare professionals.&amp;nbsp; For more information, &lt;a href="http://www.foodforyourwholelife.org/symposium/index.cfm"&gt;visit the symposium website&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

		<title type='text'>Touring a Local Organic Farm</title>
		<content type='html'>This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending a tour of &lt;a href="http://www.johnsonsbackyardgarden.com/%20"&gt;Johnson's Backyard Garden&lt;/a&gt; (JBG), the largest local CSA (community supported agriculture) farm in the area.&amp;nbsp; The tour was organized by &lt;a href="http://slowfoodaustin.org/about/%20"&gt;Slow Food Austin,&lt;/a&gt; a local member organization of Slow Food USA.&amp;nbsp; "Slow Food Austin supports activities and education to preserve biodiversity in the food supply, spread the education of taste and connect producers of excellent foods with the co-producers (consumers) through events and initiatives." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may recall that I have &lt;a href="http://marquettenutrition.blogspot.com/2009/06/what-is-csa-and-why-should-i-join.html"&gt;blogged &lt;/a&gt;about CSAs before.&amp;nbsp; Getting to see a local CSA up close and personal was great!&amp;nbsp; Farmer Brenton Johnson is fabulous!&amp;nbsp; Before the tour he told us about his background and how he came to be an organic vegetable farmer.&amp;nbsp; When he was about to graduate from college, he told us he began to think people had a tendency to constantly strive for increasing their standard of living WAY beyond what was necessary and sustainable (he was studying mechanical engineering at Purdue at the time.&amp;nbsp; For those of you who don't know, I was a mechanical engineer before I became a dietitian, so my ears really perked up when I heard that!).&amp;nbsp; I cannot do justice to exactly how he worded it, but the gist of what he said is that he thought if animals had to work for their food and shelter, we should too, rather than relying so much on devices that make our lives overly convenient.&amp;nbsp; I've never heard anyone speak about truly being a good steward of our natural resources in such a way. He said that when he spoke to his professors about it and they thought he was crazy!&amp;nbsp; Then they suggested he go talk to the Agricultural Engineering group, which he did and ultimately got his degree from that college.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward several years to where he is at today: vegetable farmer.&amp;nbsp; JBG is an organic, sustainable vegetable farm.&amp;nbsp; I never realized how complicated farming is; he is definitely putting his degree to good use.&amp;nbsp; Brenton and his staff look at all aspects of their operation in order to keep it as sustainable as possible.&amp;nbsp; They analyze each chain of events to determine what will be the best overall course of action to minimize their inputs.&amp;nbsp; For example, he described for us how traditional farmers will use plastics and drip irrigation.&amp;nbsp; A lot of people think that is a great idea because it limits evaporative water loss that you would get from using elevated sprinklers.&amp;nbsp; However, the plastic has to be replaced after virtually every crop is harvested, which means a lot of plastic going into landfills.&amp;nbsp; He and his staff believe overall it is a better use of our natural resources to avoid using the plastic liners by using sprinklers.&amp;nbsp; True, the sprinklers do cause some evaporative water loss, but his are still 80% efficient and they avoid filling up landfills with plastics.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about the details of what it takes to run their farm, but I would need to write a book!&amp;nbsp; I think if more people realized exactly how much work goes into producing sustainable, organic foods, and the care that these farmers put into producing their crops, they may be more willing to pay a little extra.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the tour, we were treated to 6 different heirloom tomato plants and two other plants (I choose heirloom eggplant!).&amp;nbsp; I was also one of the lucky people to get a sample of carrots to take home fresh from the ground!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in the ATX, I highly encourage you to attend the next tour of another local CSA that happens to be right in the City at Springdale Farm on April 10.&amp;nbsp; There will also be a tour of a dairy in nearby Schulenberg, TX on March 27.&amp;nbsp; If you do not live in Texas, please check out &lt;a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/%20"&gt;Slow Food USA&lt;/a&gt; for a local chapter for more information and farm tours in your area.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>March is National Nutrition Month®</title>
		<content type='html'>It's almost officially springtime, so of course there are lots of things going on.&amp;nbsp; If you were reading my &lt;a href="http://marquettenutrition.blogspot.com/2009/03/march-is-national-nutrition-month.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; around this time last year, you already know that March is National Nutrition Month®!&amp;nbsp; According to the &lt;a href="http://www.eatright.org/"&gt;American Dietetic Association&lt;/a&gt; (ADA) "National Nutrition Month® [NNM] is a nutrition education and information campaign sponsored annually by the American Dietetic Association." The main purpose of this campaign is to bring attention to the importance of making healthy, informed food choices and developing good eating habits.&amp;nbsp; NNM is also used to bring awareness of and promote the ADA and its members to the public and the media as the most valuable and credible source of timely, scientifically based food and nutrition information.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may remember (again from my blog last year!) that March also highlights "Registered Dietitian Day."&amp;nbsp; This year, Wednesday March 10th has been designated Registered Dietitian Day.&amp;nbsp; Per the ADA: "Registered Dietitian Day commemorates the dedication of RDs as advocates for advancing the nutritional status of Americans and people around the world."&amp;nbsp; To read more about credentialing and what RDs do, you can refer to my &lt;a href="http://marquettenutrition.blogspot.com/2009/03/march-11-is-registered-dietitian-day.html%20"&gt;blog &lt;/a&gt;last spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a registered dietitian and current member of the ADA, of course I want to help spread the word!&amp;nbsp; This year's theme is "Nutrition From the Ground Up," meaning focus on the basics.&amp;nbsp; Eat healthy by emphasizing fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of proteins, and healthy fats.&amp;nbsp; I know, that sounds like an old message, but it still holds true.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to get a variety of colors from your fruits and vegetables to ensure that you are getting not only different vitamins and minerals, but also a lot of phytonutrients that have additional health benefits.&amp;nbsp; Try to get locally grown produce; it will taste better and retain more of its nutrients since it has not been sitting on a shelf for an extended period of time.&amp;nbsp; I am a HUGE fan of CSAs (community supported agriculture) and farmer's markets.&amp;nbsp; Not only is the produce more fresh, it tastes better too!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whole grains are really high in fiber, and are a good source of complex carbohydrates, which are an excellent fuel source.&amp;nbsp; Why do we always push fiber?&amp;nbsp; It helps keep you full longer (so helps with weight management), keeps you "regular" which can help lower colon cancer risk, helps stabilize blood sugar, and helps lower cholesterol.&amp;nbsp; Pretty good reasons!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all need protein to help build muscle, make hormones, etc., but "lean" sources are emphasized to minimize fat, particularly saturated fat.&amp;nbsp; This is important again for weight management, but also to lower the risk of increasing "bad" LDL cholesterol.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course we still need "healthy fats" that have a variety of uses in the body, including lowering our risk of heart disease, providing some insulation and cushioning of our joints, keeping us full, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href="http://www.eatright.org/Public/"&gt;eatright.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>February is National Grapefruit Month!</title>
		<content type='html'>I can't let February slip by without calling attention to it being National Grapefruit Month, especially since Ruby Reds, also known as "Texas Reds," are in season right now in my home state!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit is actually a hybrid fruit.&amp;nbsp; The grapefruit as we know it was developed sometime in the 1700s by cross breeding oranges with pomelos (which are also called "Chinese Grapefruit").&amp;nbsp; The varieties include white, pink, and red.&amp;nbsp; Grapefruits are rich in vitamin C, vitamin A, lycopene, limonin, and fiber (particularly soluble fiber in the form of pectin).&amp;nbsp; Both lycopene and limonin are antioxidants that may help prevent certain types of cancer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of people have tried "The Grapefruit Diet" in an effort to lose weight.&amp;nbsp; Historically people lost weight following this diet for the simple reason that they were eating very few calories.&amp;nbsp; However, there have been a couple of studies that show that grapefruit may help with weight loss, but the exact reason is unclear, and it is not rapid weight loss.&amp;nbsp; One study was conducted in 2006 at the Nutrition and Metabolic Center at Scripps Clinic in California.&amp;nbsp; They found that eating half a grapefruit or drinking a serving of grapefruit juice before each meal caused people to lose at least 3 pounds over a 12-week period.&amp;nbsp; Researchers at Louisiana State University conducted another study in 2009; they found that people eating half a grapefruit 3 times a day were able to lose 4 pounds (on average) in 12 weeks even though they had not altered the rest of their diet.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So eating grapefruit can be healthy for you in more ways than one.&amp;nbsp; However, if you are taking certain medications, it is best to avoid grapefruit because it can significantly elevate the absorption rate of these medications in your body, which can cause negative side effects.&amp;nbsp; Examples of medications that may interact with grapefruit include those that lower blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as thyroid medications and some antihistamines.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information and recipes visit &lt;a href="http://www.texasweet.com/About-Texas-Citrus"&gt;Texas Sweet&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Cherries: Tasty and Good for You!</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;You probably all have heard that February is American Heart Month.&amp;nbsp; There are several other monthly observances in February, including National Grapefruit Month, National Cherry Month, etc.&amp;nbsp; Since I’ve been neglecting my “food specific” blogs, I thought this would be a good time to get back into food by writing about cherries!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Cherries not only taste good, but they have many health benefits as well.&amp;nbsp; For example, researchers have found that cherries are very high in a flavonoid called “quercetin” that has been shown to help prevent heart disease.&amp;nbsp; What are flavonoids?&amp;nbsp; They are plant pigments, also called phytochemicals, that have health benefits, including their “antioxidant” properties.&amp;nbsp; Antioxidants are substances that prevent or slow down damage caused by “free radicals” that are produced as a by-product when our bodies use oxygen.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.calcherry.com/health_nutrition/health_benefits.cfm"&gt;California Cherry Advisory Board,&lt;/a&gt; cherries are also beneficial for cancer prevention, pain relief, and bone health.&amp;nbsp; A phenolic acid called “amygdalin” that is found in cherries (and other fruits) “has been shown to reduce tumor size and further spread of cancer, as well as to alleviate the pains of the cancerous process.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Anthocyanins are another flavonoid found in high amounts in cherries.&amp;nbsp; Anthocyanins block inflammatory enzymes, which reduces pain associated with arthritis, gout, as well as soreness and joint pain related to exercise.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the “&lt;a href="http://www.choosecherries.com/redrecovery/index.html%20"&gt;Red Recovery Routine&lt;/a&gt;” was created by dietitian Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, LDN, CSSD to help athletes recover from exercise induced pain. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Cherries are grown in several regions in the US, but seventy percent come from four states (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Utah). The 2 main types of cherries are sweet and sour (or “tart”).&amp;nbsp; “Montgomery” is the best-known tart cherry.&amp;nbsp; It is grown primarily in the Midwest and Eastern states and is mainly canned or frozen for use as pie filling or sauce.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;There are several varieties of sweet cherries on the market.&amp;nbsp; “Bing” is the most well known.&amp;nbsp; It is large, round, extra sweet, has a deep red skin that is almost black when completely ripe and the flesh is purple-red.&amp;nbsp; Lamberts are also sweet cherries; they are smaller than Bing cherries and are more heart-shaped.&amp;nbsp; Rainer is the variety of sweet cherry that is milder, has a yellow or pinkish skin, and is grown in much smaller quantities, and Royal Ann has a blush yellow skin and is often canned or made into Maraschino cherries. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Cherries are generally in season from May to August, but can be found dried, frozen, or canned year round.&amp;nbsp; When buying fresh cherries, choose those with the stem on.&amp;nbsp; They should be bright, shiny, and free from blemishes.&amp;nbsp; Sweet cherries should be firm and tart cherries should be medium-firm.&amp;nbsp; Avoid cherries with cuts, bruises, stale/dry stems, or that are soft.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Store unwashed cherries in the refrigerator in a plastic bag or in a single layer in a pan covered with plastic wrap.&amp;nbsp; Good cherries should last for up to a week.&amp;nbsp; Wash cherries just before eating, and allow to come to room temperature for better flavor.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;You can also freeze cherries by rinsing and draining thoroughly.&amp;nbsp; To avoid having the cherries take on an “almond” flavor, remove the pits prior to freezing.&amp;nbsp; You can either place them in a plastic bag or spread on a cookie sheet and freeze “individually” prior to placing them in a plastic bag for storage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Recovering After the Marathon</title>
		<content type='html'>First, I want to wish good luck to all my peeps running the Austin Marathon and Half Marathon this coming Sunday!&amp;nbsp; What a way to celebrate Valentine’s Day!&amp;nbsp; You all will definitely deserve a celebration dinner afterward! Now, let’s talk about how to recover after running 26.2 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recovering properly means you need to take into account both nutrition and activity.&amp;nbsp; I remember when I ran my very first marathon; I ran way too many miles each week (and way too many “other” races!) and didn’t do enough cross training.&amp;nbsp; I also had some issues with my form (partially due to lack of core strength). As a result, I ended up with ITB Syndrome and had to walk a lot of the second half of the marathon because I was in so much pain and my right leg just would not bend.&amp;nbsp; I was so tired when I finished that I didn’t feel like eating initially and instead took a nap for about 6 hours! I knew that not eating enough within a couple of hours (max) was not good, but I had no idea how just laying around would make things so much worse.&amp;nbsp; I got up for a light snack, then went back to bed and didn’t get back up until the next day.&amp;nbsp; I had a lot of trouble walking the first couple of days; both of my legs were sore for at least a week!&amp;nbsp; Back then, I was not aware of the benefits of an ice water bath or a short walk later in the day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know better!&amp;nbsp; The more marathons I have run, the less sore I am afterward.&amp;nbsp; At this point, within a few days I am back to running short mileage, and within 2 weeks, back up to 10+ miles for my weekend “long runs.”&amp;nbsp; Maintaining a high level of fitness year round and knowing all the little “tricks” to recovery have helped tremendously.&amp;nbsp; I have found that the single most important thing for my own personal recovery is how well I trained prior to the event.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully you have followed a training plan that included a good amount of base mileage as well as other exercises to keep your muscles in balance; that is the foundation for your recovery.&amp;nbsp; If you have not trained properly for your marathon, you will definitely feel more pain both during and after the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other “must do’s” to speed your recovery: 1. Eat the snacks provided at the finish line.&amp;nbsp; At the bare minimum drink some sports drink AND water, but ideally eat some solid carbs as well, such as fruit or bars.&amp;nbsp; Make sure you have a balanced meal that includes protein and some healthy fat a few hours later; 2.&amp;nbsp; Do an ice water bath for 20 minutes within a few hours of finishing.&amp;nbsp; You will be amazed at how well an ice bath will reduce inflammation and muscle soreness; and 3.&amp;nbsp; Go for an easy 10 – 20 minute walk later that evening to loosen up the leg muscles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is normal to start feeling muscle soreness after the event, which can last for a few days (and in some people up to 1 week) afterward.&amp;nbsp; The next day, it is not uncommon to feel a little “down,” especially if it is your first marathon and the soreness and fatigue start to settle in.&amp;nbsp; That’s o.k.; just try to take it easy.&amp;nbsp; If you want to go for a run, make sure you run on a nice flat surface, preferably something soft such as a track.&amp;nbsp; Make sure to take it easy and listen to your body!&amp;nbsp; Limit your self to just 10 – 15 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Try some light stretching.&amp;nbsp; Go to bed early as your body is still rebuilding and repairing tissue that was damaged the day before.&amp;nbsp; Also be sure to get a massage a couple of days after the race to help flush out any knots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it may seem like a lot of people run marathons, those of you who complete a marathon are still part of a relatively small percentage of the overall population.&amp;nbsp; After accomplishing such a big feat, most people experience an incredible high.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to know what to do after meeting such a big goal.&amp;nbsp; The first week after, try not to make any specific plans.&amp;nbsp; Continue to eat well-balanced meals and do some light physical activity, but definitely do not push yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first marathon, it may take you a full month to recover completely and feel like you are back to your pre-race level of fitness.&amp;nbsp; Don’t let this high level of fitness slip away!&amp;nbsp; If you don’t feel like you want to run a lot at first, try something else.&amp;nbsp; Consider cycling, swimming, or hiking.&amp;nbsp; Maybe try your hand at triathlon.&amp;nbsp; But please, do not stop exercising.&amp;nbsp; Your body is at a high level of fitness; keep building on it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes for a great race and a speedy recovery, and I will see you all at the race!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Countdown to the Austin Marathon</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Well, it’s that time of year again!&amp;nbsp; The Austin Marathon is less than 2 weeks away!&amp;nbsp; At this point, you should be in taper mode, as there is nothing more you can do to get physically ready for this race.&amp;nbsp; You may remember last year I also wrote a &lt;a href="http://marquettenutrition.blogspot.com/2009/02/austin-marathon-february-15-2009.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about what to do the week before the race.&amp;nbsp; If this is your first marathon, you may want to review that post for specifics on nutrition, hydration, preparing your race gear, etc.&amp;nbsp; In this post, I’d like to spend some time on the “mental preparation” that needs to happen for you to have a successful race.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marathon is not for wimps!&amp;nbsp; 26.2 miles is a long way, and anything can happen.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Whether this is your first marathon or whether you have done several, no two race experiences are exactly the same.&amp;nbsp; If you tend to get nervous before events, or if you have had bad experiences in races in the past, it is important to be prepared mentally for whatever happens.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visualize your perfect race: how do you feel at the start?&amp;nbsp; Visualize yourself running the first few miles at an easy pace, getting your body warmed up.&amp;nbsp; You hit your water stops with ease, tolerate your nutrition with no stomach queasiness, and the miles just seem to click by.&amp;nbsp; Before you know it, you are at the halfway point and feeling great.&amp;nbsp; You feel so good that you start to pick up your pace a little bit.&amp;nbsp; Now you are at the 30K mark, having a great race.&amp;nbsp; You are remembering to drink your water, take your supplements, eat your snacks, and wave to the crowd.&amp;nbsp; Now you are entering the home stretch.&amp;nbsp; You only have 0.2 miles to go.&amp;nbsp; You wipe your face off, straighten up your shirt and bib, and smile for the cameras.&amp;nbsp; Now you have less than 0.1 miles to go; you pick up speed, starting to pass other runners as you cross the finish line, arms lifted in triumph!&amp;nbsp; The crowd goes wild!!!&amp;nbsp; You slow down, get your medal, and head into the finishers area to collect your goodies.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds great, doesn’t it?&amp;nbsp; But we all know that unexpected things can happen that can cause your race to be less than perfect.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it’s super windy that morning, or raining, or hot!&amp;nbsp; What will you do?&amp;nbsp; Having a mantra that you truly believe in, or some type of mental picture of someone (yourself or someone else) overcoming adversity is a powerful tool that you can use to get yourself through tough patches.&amp;nbsp; If you have run in my training group, you have already experienced all sorts of weather extremes, so you know you can handle it.&amp;nbsp; Draw on those positive past experiences and know that you can handle the weather.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if you start to cramp?&amp;nbsp; If it is a side stitch, push into the area where you are experiencing the tightness and breath slowly and deeply in and out. You may need to slow your pace down a little.&amp;nbsp; If you have had side stitches before, you know that they will pass.&amp;nbsp; Use your mantra or visual image.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if you start to experience pain in your knee/back/ankle, etc?&amp;nbsp; First, assess the pain level.&amp;nbsp; Is it so severe that you are starting to run with a limp?&amp;nbsp; Are you recovering from an injury?&amp;nbsp; If not, is this a “phantom” pain?&amp;nbsp; Often times if we have not had any injuries in training, as we start to feel fatigued during an event, our mind and body can start to play tricks on us.&amp;nbsp; Focus on keeping your form, remember to breathe, and continue to run for at least 2-3 more minutes (time yourself), then re-assess.&amp;nbsp; Again, use your mantra or your visual image.&amp;nbsp; Use the crowd for support!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if your stomach starts acting up?&amp;nbsp; If you tolerate some type of antacid (such as Tums, Rolaids, etc.), plan to carry some with you “just in case.”&amp;nbsp; Don’t be afraid to stop and use the port-o-potties because you’ll “lose too much time.” If you try to avoid stopping and run too long on an upset stomach, you will likely feel worse, slow down your pace significantly, and eventually end up having to stop at a port-o-potty anyway.&amp;nbsp; Once you start running after your “pit stop,” again re-assess how you feel and determine whether you can safely continue.&amp;nbsp; If you can safely continue, lean on your mantra.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are recovering from injury, know your limitations and lower your expectations.&amp;nbsp; If you are already planning to finish “no matter what,” be prepared to have to walk. Take in the crowd, the bands, the volunteers and plan on just enjoying the fact that you are still physically able to walk in a marathon!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Food 101</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Did any of you watch Oprah this past week when her show was titled “Food 101 with Michael Pollan”?&amp;nbsp; Michael Pollan is not a nutritionist; he is a journalist and book author who has been researching food and health for over 20 years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Due to his vast years of research on the food industry in our nation, and diets around the world, I think he can legitimately be considered an expert on how food is manufactured and how it affects our health.&amp;nbsp; He currently has a new book out called Food Rules.&amp;nbsp; His previous 3 books include &lt;i&gt;The Omnivore’s Dilemma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Young Reader’s Edition of the Omnivore’s Dilemma&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;In Defense of Food&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I have to admit I have not read any of his books (yet!), but I am familiar with his research and I did watch the documentary Food Inc. in which he appears.&amp;nbsp; I was really glad to see Oprah take on the subject of where our food comes from, factory farms versus local farmers, and the fact that how we treat animals and what we feed them has a direct impact on our own health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of the show, Oprah gave everyone a little “food” quiz.&amp;nbsp; One of the most interesting (and disheartening) questions asked was regarding antibiotic use in the livestock industry: “Americans take 3 million pounds of antibiotics a year.&amp;nbsp; How many pounds are given to livestock?”&amp;nbsp; The answer:&amp;nbsp; 28 MILLION pounds!!!&amp;nbsp; And we wonder why so many antibiotic resistant diseases (such as MRSA) are popping up.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pollan noted that there are all sorts of different types of diets around the world (e.g the Inuit in Greenland have 75% of their diet come from fat – primarily in the form of seal blubber, one particular tribe in Africa eats a lot of beef and drinks cow blood, other countries eat high carbohydrate diets, etc.).&amp;nbsp; The thing these diets have in common is that they are made up of whole, fresh foods and not heavily processed foods.&amp;nbsp; What else do these people have in common?&amp;nbsp; They have virtually no incidence of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, etc.&amp;nbsp; The point Pollan was trying to drive home is that we can eat a variety of different types of diets, but the key to being healthy is using minimally processed foods.&amp;nbsp; This is something I have really tried to emphasize to my clients as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the problem I have run into in trying to get people to eat more fresh food is the cost.&amp;nbsp; A lot of people I work with complain that it is too expensive to eat healthy.&amp;nbsp; According to Pollan, thirty plus years ago, Americans spent 18% of their income on food and nationally Americans spent about 5% on health care.&amp;nbsp; Today Americans spend &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;9% of their income on food, less than any other population on the planet, yet nationally Americans spend 17% on health care.&amp;nbsp; Between health care and food, in total we are spending about 3% more now than we did in the past.&amp;nbsp; What does that tell you?&amp;nbsp; Would you rather spend a little more on eating healthy and in turn feel better, have more energy, and get sick less often; or would you rather have the convenience of buying and eating cheap, heavily processed food but then need to visit the doctor more often to get medications for allergies, insomnia, blood pressure, diabetes, etc.?&amp;nbsp; We all have to make a decision about who we would rather pay; the farmer or the doctor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oprah also had Alicia Silverstone, actress and co-author of the book The Kind Diet, appear via satellite.&amp;nbsp; Alicia has been a practicing vegan for the past 10 plus years, and her new book is basically a “guide” of how to eat a more plant based diet including a number of recipes and other tips.&amp;nbsp; She gave her own personal testimonial about how improving her eating habits improved her health.&amp;nbsp; She also took viewers on a virtual grocery shopping trip and demonstrated preparing a recipe out of her new book.&amp;nbsp; Her role was showing that eating healthy does not have to be difficult or take a lot of time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another guest was Steve Ells, founder and CEO of Chipotle restaurants.&amp;nbsp; Steve is a chef who had a desire to open up his own restaurant when he first finished culinary school.&amp;nbsp; He now has Chipotle’s all over the country.&amp;nbsp; Even though Chipotle is considered a “fast food” restaurant, they do not provide your typical highly processed food.&amp;nbsp; Ells stated that all of their produce is fresh with the exception of corn (frozen), and each restaurant purchases from local farmers when seasons permit.&amp;nbsp; In addition, 45% of their beans are organic, 60% of their beef is “naturally raised” (meaning the cattle are not given antibiotics or growth hormones and are allowed to graze on grass rather than fed grain in feed lots), and 100% of their pork and chicken is naturally raised.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ells opened his first Chipotle in 1993; last year his restaurants served over 700,000 people and had over $1 Billion in sales!&amp;nbsp; He has shown that you can be successful at using fresh, organic, and naturally raised meats while still providing consumers with a reasonably priced meal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can read more about the show, as well as take the quiz, by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/The-Truth-About-Food-with-Michael-Pollan"&gt;Oprah's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.

		<title type='text'>Running a Marathon after the Flu</title>
		<content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;This past Sunday, January 17, 2010, my husband and I went to Houston, TX to run the Chevron Houston Marathon.&amp;nbsp; It was our first race in Houston and we had both been looking forward to it as we had heard that the race was very well supported and a “fast, flat course.”&amp;nbsp; Living in Austin, we are used to running up some massive hills, so our marathon is not exactly a “fast” course!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, he came down with the flu the day after Christmas, and I got it one week later.&amp;nbsp; So, he had just recovered about 2 weeks before the race, and I just had one week of recovery under my belt.&amp;nbsp; Needless to say, neither of us expected to have a very fast time, but we were still expecting to have fun.&amp;nbsp; After all, it should be much easier than what we are used to running, we told ourselves!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you may remember from my blog a couple of weeks ago, when you are coming back from a sickness involving a fever, you should really take at least 10 days to ramp back up to your previous workout level.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, I did not have that long.&amp;nbsp; Running the marathon meant that I was going to go beyond my “pre-sickness” workout level after just 7 days, as my previous long run was just a 30K.&amp;nbsp; Knowing that my body was still in “ramp up mode,” I decided the safest course of action was to run the race at a slow, even pace (which for me means I started out running about 30 – 45 seconds slower than my normal marathon race pace).&amp;nbsp; I also planned to have more protein, in addition to carbohydrates, immediately before as well as during the race to hopefully keep myself well fueled and able to handle the demands of a race my body really probably should not have been doing so soon after being sick.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pre-race nutrition, we did our normal things for the most part.&amp;nbsp; Since this was a “destination race,” the night before we made sure we would be able to get food either at the hotel restaurant, or at the hotel’s “grab and go” area.&amp;nbsp; I had also packed us plenty of snacks in case we would not be able to get what we needed.&amp;nbsp; Luckily, the restaurant opened at 5 a.m., while the grab and go area was open at 4 a.m.&amp;nbsp; Plenty of time, and lots of options! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bowl of cold cereal with milk about 2 hours before the race was scheduled to start, while my husband had a cup of orange juice, a cup of black coffee, a small bowl of oatmeal, and some fruit (he’s much taller/bigger than I am!).&amp;nbsp; About one hour before, we both had a boiled egg, along with some water (I had brought the boiled eggs from home and had them stashed with a freezer pack in our room).&amp;nbsp; About 30 – 45 minutes prior to the race, my husband and I also both drank a full 20 ounces of Accelerade (sports drink with both carbohydrates and protein, in addition to electrolytes).&amp;nbsp; In addition, he ate a full Lara bar and I ate about half of one (this is something we have not traditionally done in the past, but I felt like we could use the protein).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I would pop a sports gel of some sort (or sports beans) about 15 minutes before the race, but because I had just had half a Lara bar, I really didn’t feel like I needed one, so I skipped it.&amp;nbsp; I did pack 4 for during the race “just in case.” I also packed some “real food” (by that I mean I had a snack size baggie of dried apricots and the other half of my Lara bar!).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the race, besides running slower, I also planned to stop and walk at each water stop, which is something I usually do anyway because I’ve never been very good at running and drinking at the same time!&amp;nbsp; For about the first half, most of my walk breaks were around 15 – 30 seconds, but as the miles ticked on, these breaks got up to 1 minute.&amp;nbsp; I ate 1-2 apricots at most of the stops until I ran out (around mile 16), then I took a few more miles to finish the rest of my bar.&amp;nbsp; While I was eating the apricots and the bar, I just drank water at the stops because Gatorade was the sports drink on the course and I do not normally drink Gatorade and was afraid of what it would do to me.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, I went to my gel (Cliff shots); actually I only used one, which was around mile 22 or 23.&amp;nbsp; I did have a couple of sips of Gatorade at the last 2 or 3 water stops, but I also had some water afterward to get the taste out of my mouth!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I felt pretty good during most of the race.&amp;nbsp; I did have a much harder time breathing than I normally would, and I did have a slightly upset stomach, but nothing unbearable.&amp;nbsp; I also slowed way down the last 3 miles, but this was due to some knee pain I developed going down a stretch of the course that had severe banking.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that we both really enjoyed the race, and were pleasantly surprised by our finishing times, which were close to “normal” times for both of us; mine was actually a PR by a few minutes!&amp;nbsp; The race was extremely well supported; there were lots of people throughout most of the course cheering on all the runners; most of the water stops were well staffed and stocked; there were LOTS of port-o-potties shortly after the water stops (so many that I actually decided to stop around mile 11 because there was no line!&amp;nbsp; I lost about 3 minutes, but it made for a much more comfortable rest of the run!); and at the end there was a very nice sitting area where you could enjoy a hot meal, along with hot coffee, hot chocolate, hot tea, or cold drinks.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, running a marathon after getting sick late in training can be done, but you have to be very diligent about listening to your body, running at an easy pace, and fueling properly before, during, and after the race.&amp;nbsp; Aim to just have fun rather than expecting to get a PR!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S1tqs4dWcvI/AAAAAAAAAIw/HGnXnH2-7aw/s1600-h/Pre-Marathon+1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zTaUFxkw-M0/S1tqs4dWcvI/AAAAAAAAAIw/HGnXnH2-7aw/s320/Pre-Marathon+1.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Christine E.
