# MarquetteNutrition

Repository of ASP.Net website for Marquette Nutrition & Fitness.
This was my wife's private dietitian practice.  I built the website originally in MVC 2, and then future iterations were rebuilt in MVC3 and finally this current version is MVC 4.  The site tied into a Microsoft SQL Server backend where I tracked her clients, prospective clients who downloaded free pdf's, and also maintained an online calendar of her speaking engagements.
